#**** USER LOGIN & MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ****

#Purpose of program 
This is a program for user login and users management system developed in Java by me - Mahder Birhan (Maddie) in 2025. The system allows users to create, login and manage their accounts via console-based menu.The two types of users which the system supports include 
- Admin and 
- Regular/Guest users 

#Features Included 
- -> To add a new user to the system
- -> To view users list 
- -> To search for a user in the user record
- -> To login into the system and out of the system (deactivate/remove)
- -> If the user has completed then they can exit the system  

#Special features and updates made
- Only admin can deactivate a user
- Password validation 
- User credentials storage 
- Login and user audit log (the user records file)
- Clear code style 
- Clear comments 
- Organised file structure 

#Prerequisites 
- Java 17 or higher 
- Preferred IDE -> Eclipse 
 

#Running the program 
This is a simple to medium java program and so once its imported to eclipse it could be run and check it works ...
1.  Import the Assignment project to Eclipse 
2.  Access the 'Assignment' project
3. (optional) Access the Docs files before running and 
    - 	-> Read the 'Pseudocode' to understand the flow of the program 
    - -> Read the 'README' file 
4. Navigate through the default package 
5. Run the The test files to check if the code actually runs
5. Run the 'Main.java' file to access the user management system menu and start playing around with the system   

#Usage and examples:
choices to enter once the menu is displayed:
 - "1" -> to add a new user. Username will be required and a password, and if th user is admin or just a regular  user 
 - "2" -> to view users. It will list all the users and their login status 
 - "3" -> to search for a specific user using their user name. The user will need to enter the user name to look up for 
 - "4" -> to loginto the system incase you are deactivated or not logged in. The user is required to enter their username and password and if they are found the user and their status will be displayed 
 - "5" -> to deactivate or log the user out of the system. 
 - "6" -> to exit out of the system
 - anything else will not work and error messages will be dispayed with a chance to reenter choice.
 

#Future improvements
- Having a simple GUI based program rather than console based
- Password encryption for security purposes or password manager
- Personlised user systems
